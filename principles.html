    <h2>Mission Viejo Chess Club</h2>
    <p>
      The Mission Viejo Chess Club has Established a club ranking system for its
      members that will allow you to progress from pawn up to king by being
      active and attending club events either online, or in person, and showing
      chess knowledge. Below are the ranks and required knowledge for each rank.
    </p>
    <h3>Opening Principles</h3>
    <p>Memorize the first 4 in <strong>bold</strong> for promotion.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Open with a center pawn until you reach expert level</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Develop all pieces before moving any piece twice, if possible. Get the
          whole team into the game.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li><strong>Develop your knights before bishops.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Castle as soon as possible, preferably before move 10 and on the king
          side.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>Make as few pawn moves as possible in the opening.</li>
      <li>
        Develop pieces with threats if you can, or to block a threat. Try to do
        double duty.
      </li>
      <li>Don't bring out your queen to early.</li>
      <li>Always play to gain control of the center.</li>
      <li>Try to maintain at least one pawn in the center.</li>
      <li>Don't sacrifice without a clear and adequate reason.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Middlegame Principles</h3>
    <p>
      Memorize at least 3 of the first 5 in <strong>bold</strong> for promotion.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Assess all threata against you on this move or the next
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Ask: What if your opponent had another move, what would you hate?
            </li>
            <li>Look at Checks, Captures, and Attacks (CCA) against you.</li>
            <li>
              If any CCA’s, deal with it by moving, blocking, or with a more
              powerful counter attack.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Ask what your opponent's last move accomplished? What did it leave
          unprotected or weak?</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Increase the activity of your pieces by moving them forward and to
          the center.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Decrease your opponent's activty by restricting their pieces or
          trading off their most active ones.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Find your worst pieces with the least activity (worst position) and
          improve it.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Examine all Checks, Captures, and Attacks you can make against your
        opponent. Especially checks since they take priority. Calculate it even
        if it looks crazy, there might just be a tactic or a mate after a
        sacrifice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have all your moves fit into a definite plans?
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Rules of Planning
            <ol>
              <li>a plan must be suggested by some feature in the position.</li>
              <li>a plan must be based on sound strategic principles.</li>
              <li>a plan must be flexible,</li>
              <li>concrete, and</li>
              <li>short.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples of Plans
            <ol>
              <li>Attack the king and checkmate him.</li>
              <li>
                Shift pieces to one side of board to the other for an attack.
              </li>
              <li>Open the center if opponent has not castled.</li>
              <li>Shore up defense around your king so he’s safer.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluating a Position
            <ol>
              <li>Material,</li>
              <li>Pawn Structure,</li>
              <li>Piece Mobility,</li>
              <li>King Safety, and</li>
              <li>Enemy Threats</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are material ahead, exchange as many pieces as possible,
        especially queens.
      </li>
      <li>Avoid serious pawn weaknesses.</li>
      <li>In cramped positions free yourself by exchanging.</li>
      <li>
        Don't bring your king out with your opponent's queen on the board.
      </li>
      <li>Look for any double attacks you can make.</li>
      <li>
        If your opponent has one or more pieces exposed, look for a combination.
      </li>
      <li>
        In superior positions, to attack the enemy king, you must open a file
        (or less often a diagonal) for your heavy pieces (queen and rooks).
      </li>
      <li>In even positions, centralize the action of all your pieces.</li>
      <li>
        In inferior positions, the best defense is to counter-attack if
        possible.
      </li>
    </ol>
